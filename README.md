# 🏭 Conveyor Belt System Simulation in Unity

A simple conveyor belt simulation built with Unity, featuring object spawning, adjustable conveyor speed, and start/stop control. This project is ideal for demonstrating basic automation concepts or prototyping low-poly factory environments.

## 🎮 Key Features

- 🧱 **Spawn Objects**  
  Instantly spawn prefab objects onto the conveyor belt, either manually or automatically.

- ⏩ **Adjust Conveyor Speed**  
  Easily control the conveyor's speed (fast/slow) through scripts or parameters.

- ⏹ **Start/Stop Conveyor**  
  Pause or resume the conveyor belt anytime during runtime.

- ❌ **Delete Zone**  
  A designated area where objects on the conveyor belt can be removed automatically.

## 📦 Asset Used

- [Low Poly Factory Machine Pack Demo – Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/industrial/low-poly-factory-machine-pack-demo-272637)  

## 🧰 Requirements

- Unity Editor **2021.3 LTS** or newer
- No external dependencies besides the Unity Asset Store package above
